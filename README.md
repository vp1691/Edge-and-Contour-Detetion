# Edge and Countour Detetion

Edges: Edges is actually the analysis of the discontinues in the images. Usually edges are found or occur on the boundary of two objects


Contours: Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points (along the boundary), having same color or intensity. 

Algorithm

Canny edge Detection:-
The Canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. It was developed by John F. 
Canny in 1986. Canny also produced a computational theory of edge detection explaining why the technique works.


The Canny edge detection algorithm is composed of 5 steps:

  1) Noise reduction
  2) Gradient calculation
  3) Non-maximum suppression
  4) Double threshold
  5) Edge Tracking by Hysteresis.
